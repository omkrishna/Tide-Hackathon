# Tide-Hackathon

## Problem Statement <br>
Weather has a notable impact on the agricultural industry.
Wind speed, humidity, temperature, and solar radiation among
others are very important weather parameters for agricultural
processes like irrigation, pest and disease control,
fertilizer/manure delivery, etc. Appropriate use of Weather
information can be used for precision agriculture, which will
result in judicious use of resources and proper control over
crop growth. Such collective intelligent decisions will also result
in financial savings. For instance, knowing rainfall forecast
information can help in saving irrigation costs. Suggest ways to
use weather forecast data and past season-based data to
provide real-time and practical advice to agriculturalists so as to
minimize crop damage and maximize productivity with minimal
resource expenditure. Information can be extracted through
drones, sensors, weather prediction data from various
sites/apps, etc. The deliverable should be able to recommend
day to day agricultural activities along with the appropriate
amount of chemicals/water needed for the tasks.
